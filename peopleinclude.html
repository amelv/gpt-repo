    <h2>Thomas
        Wilson
        Dorr
    </h2>1805 - 1854<p>Thomas Dorr was born into privilege in November 1805, a scion of one of Rhode Island’s wealthiest
        families. His father, Sullivan Dorr, was a Providence businessman and prominent China trade merchant. Educated
        at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and then at Harvard University (class of 1823), Thomas Dorr studied
        law for two years in New York City under Chancellor James Kent, the author of one of the leading American legal
        texts of the first half of the nineteenth century, before being admitted to the Rhode Island bar in 1827. Dorr
        opened a law office on College Street, but the restless young man was not yet ready to settle down. He toured
        the country for almost six years and occasionally practiced maritime and commercial law in New York City before
        returning to Providence in 1833. In the 1830s, Dorr championed numerous reform causes, including public
        education, freedom of speech, banking, anti-slavery, suffrage extension, imprisonment for debt and prison
        reform. Dorr began his career as a devout Whig, with a deep and abiding love of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster.
        However, disagreements over banking reform and suffrage extension led to his expulsion from the party. He would
        later head the equal rights wing of the state's Democratic Party. In 1834, as a newly elected member of Rhode
        Island’s General Assembly, Dorr joined the Constitutionalist Party, a third-party effort that picked up the
        reform torch from associations of native-born workingmen. The goal of the party was to secure a new constitution
        that would expand the suffrage for white males and address the state's apportionment problem. (Authored by Dr.
        Erik J. Chaput, 2012)</p>

        As Secretary of State under President John Tyler during the Dorr Rebellion, Webster attempted to broker a peace
        deal with Dorr and the Charter authorities.
        On several occasions he met with representatives of both Rhode
        Island’s Charter government and the People’s government
        in an attempt to resolve the “RI Controversy”. In May 1842 he journeyed to New York City in an attempt to strike
        a compromise. His efforts failed.
        Webster, a staunch supporter of Law &amp; Order, would
        several years later go on to defend the Law and Order
        position in the United States Supreme Court’s hearing
        of Luther v. Borden.</p>
